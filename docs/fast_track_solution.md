# Fast Track Solution
Here you can see an example of a screen built with our solution. Although we talk about heavy data manipulation, the out-of-the-box screens are still appealing and invite for usage. Not only the aesthetics is taken care of but also the user interaction is clear and crisp.

During an extended time, you are able to run the new system next to your existing one. Moreover our fast track solution is extremely open and all components are built on top of open source.

That’s Why We’ve Built Your Fast Track
Apart from a whole set of tools, generators and best practices we have two solutions immediately ready for use. The Vaiz Power Admin, specially tailored towards the professional power user. This is a model that only comes with a mandatory subscription. We believe that these kind of sophisticated tools are of no use when they are not assisted by trained and experienced personnel to get the best out of this tool.

The Vaizr REST API we have completely open sourced to give back on the community on which strong shoulders we build our solutions.
If Vaizr REST API is so great, why open source it rather than keep it proprietary? The answer is simpler than you might think:

We believe fast delivery and quality are key ingredient to the innovative products and technologies of the future. Attempts in this area are global and growing fast, but lacks standard openness. By sharing what we believe to be one of the best Rest API toolboxes in the world, we hope to create substantial foothold for the new open standard for exchanging information, knowledge, ideas and putting immediate connectivity into products.
