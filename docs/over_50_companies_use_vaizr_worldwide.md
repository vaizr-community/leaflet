# Over 50 Companies Use Vaizr Worldwide

Vaizr transformed the Assai application with the Vaizr low-code  platform. The new application was deployed within one year at more than 50 clients worldwide. The transformed application is user-friendly, fast and beautiful. Data entry and retrieval have become incredibly simple.

Our document management application supports major engineering and construction projects world wide. 

The outdated Oracle Forms interface was becoming a real handicap selling the system. End users disliked the old fashioned style.

Vaizr helped us to convert the software 1 to 1. Fast and reliable. Of course we had our issues and needed to test the software. But the full migration was completed well within project planning.
Expected, but much better than hoped for: Feedback from end users is fantastic. End users have a much warmer feeling for the product. They love to work with the system. New users need substantially less training. 

For us an easy migration of clients around the world was an important aspect. Users could run in parallel the old Forms next to the new Vaizr interface. This reduced the risk concerning business continuity. Therefore hardly any meetings were required to convince the clients to move forward.

For us Vaizr has been an enormous success story.
